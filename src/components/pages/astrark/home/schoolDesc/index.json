  "genetic": "Evelyn Wells' parents were renowned genetic evolution scientists within the Omega Dome and influential members of the Joint Council. Like her parents, she displayed astonishing intelligence and talent from an early age. Under their careful guidance, Evelyn completed all her studies by the age of 15 and joined the family business.\nWithin the research institute, Evelyn specialized in the development of a potion designed to enhance vitality. However, the unsettling side effects of the potion became apparent during the research. While some test subjects exhibited significant increases in vitality, nearly half displayed extreme agitation. Three subjects even synthesized unstable explosives within their bodies, destroying everything around them.\nFrustrated, Evelyn decided to secretly ingest the potion she was studying to obtain more accurate data and reactions. Strangely, a unique phenomenon occurred: her body simultaneously experienced both positive and negative effects. Fortunately, the powerful genes of the Wells family spared Evelyn from the explosive outcome.\nRecognizing the military application of this potion, Evelyn refined it through numerous experiments. She successfully separated the two distinct manifestations of the potion's effects. Surprisingly, due to her extensive self-experimentation, Evelyn found that... she no longer needed the potion.",
  "mechanoid": "Marcus Poseidius Otto, once a rising star in the Holy See's Sanctuary Order, was the epitome of excellence. As the foremost surgeon in the entire Holy See, Marcus had saved countless lives and limbs, a feat that could rival the annual devastation caused by the Purification Order. Not only did he shine in clinical practice, but Marcus also excelled in medical research. The drugs he developed for the healing and rehabilitation of external injuries proved to be remarkably effective. The armed priests of the Purification Order affectionately referred to this series of products as \"Marcus's Gifts.\" Alongside his professional success, Marcus's union with his wife, Nysa Gamila, became a celebrated tale throughout the Holy See. Nysa, herself a top-notch neuroscientist, was Marcus's right-hand woman in his research. Rumors even suggested that \"Marcus's Gifts\" should be more accurately termed \"Nysa's Contributions.\"\nHowever, fate's cruel irony often unfolds in unexpected ways. One day, after lunch at the restaurant, Marcus, oblivious, failed to notice an approaching Pegasus train that failed to brake in time—the renowned high-speed public transportation system of the Seat of the Omniscient.\n\"Marcus's Gifts,\" Nysa's care, and the collective support of the entire medical community of the Holy See preserved Marcus's life. Still, they couldn't restore his ability to stand or even lift his right shoulder without pain. Even someone as loyal as Marcus couldn't help but envy the seemingly despicable Astra Federation or the The Order—where the injuries inflicted by a Pegasus train could surely be remedied.\nNysa quickly grasped her husband's thoughts. She didn't blame Marcus, but she wouldn't allow him to fall into a more perilous situation than illness—an act of betrayal against the Holy See, against the Omniscient. Doing everything in her power, Nysa eventually acquired a mysterious glyph pendant from the catacombs beneath the Himar Mountains on the Old Home, a relic that held the potential to save her husband.\nYet, when she opened the door to the Seat of the Omniscient, Marcus was already gone. What followed became a story known throughout the cosmic civilization, marking one of the greatest scandals in Holy See history. \"Sanctuary Order Cardinal Marcus Otto Joins Omega\" dominated the headlines for a solid two weeks.\nNysa could hardly recognize her husband on the screen. Almost every part of Marcus, once the object of her deep affection, now appeared so unfamiliar…",
  "spiritual": "Nysa Gamila's life was undoubtedly enviable. Descending from four generations of illustrious bishops in the Holy See's Omniscient Order, Nysa was a bona fide aristocrat in the cosmic civilization. Not to mention her own talents, she lived up to the family's distinguished reputation. Proficient in psychic control and boasting an exceptionally developed neural capacity that even the scholars at the Star Federation Research Institute admired, coupled with her naturally calm and composed demeanor, she became the youngest Cardinal in the history of the Holy See's Sanctuary Order.\nNysa's radiance was so dazzling that at her wedding, many felt that her equally outstanding counterpart, Marcus Poseidius Otto, another Cardinal in the Sanctuary Order, had struck a considerable jackpot. While Marcus was a renowned healing prodigy in the Holy See, many believed that his success was entirely indebted to Nysa's assistance. Nysa herself remained oblivious to such notions; for her, Marcus was the universe.\nThe shocking accident that befell Marcus, shaking the foundations of the Holy See, changed everything. Though Marcus survived the accident, the limited medical resources of the Holy See made it impossible for him to return to his former self. Despite the Holy See's immense wealth, surpassing even the combined fortunes of the Star Federation and the The Order, the strict doctrines prohibited any modifications to the human body. Marcus, discontent brewing, remained silent, but Nysa sensed his growing dissatisfaction, on the verge of attracting the attention of the Purification Order's Judges.\nTo save Marcus, Nysa tried every conceivable method. The only unexplored avenue, and consequently the one yet to meet failure, was a journey to the catacombs beneath the Maril Mountains on the long-dead planet of Gea Prime. Here, she sought a mysterious runic pendant, a legendary artifact.\nNo one, besides Nysa herself, knew how she obtained the pendant. What people could witness upon her return was a Nysa who had lost all vitality and... her physical form. Nysa Gamila, once a living being, had transformed into an almost intangible and untouchable phantom. Thirteen years might have been too long, but for the sake of saving her husband, Nysa harbored no regrets.\nHowever, Nysa did not receive Marcus's embrace upon her return. Instead, she faced the retribution for Marcus's defection from the Star Federation. Despite eventually being exonerated, Nysa's pendant had served its purpose.\nShe used it on herself.",
  "natural": "Aldric Skar was born in the Holy See's outpost on Smyrna in St Bartholomew Galaxy and underwent a highly traditional spiritual education from a young age—extreme piety, devoted asceticism, suppression of desires—all in pursuit of cultivating the purest human spirit and dreaming of the ultimate fusion with the Bosdyle.\nHis mother, more influential than the Omniscient, was initially a priestess of the Vyraska clan, a family that fell into blood slavery after the fanatic cult of the Omniscient took control. However, after Aldric's monk father \"purified\" the clan, she embraced the embrace of the Omniscient and lived in Shima'na.\nUnder his mother's influence, young Aldric retained a lingering longing for nature and greenery beneath the purple robes of the Omniscient.\nAt the age of 11, Aldric's mother left this dimensional plane. Following the long-standing tradition of the Vyraska clan's extinction, Aldric buried his mother's ashes beneath a sacred tree. Each evening, under the guise of meditation, he would offer pure spiritual energy to his departed mother.\nHeretical worship was strictly forbidden. Fortunately, Aldric grew up to become a renowned combat monk under the Holy See's subordinate Purification Order. The fanatics of the Silent Order may not have liked Aldric, but they dared not hastily accuse a monk with remarkable military achievements. Simultaneously, the two steel-wrought whips Aldric wielded in his magic also played a role: they were two seemingly soft but thorn-covered whips, crafted entirely from secret silver.\nEverything proceeded as usual until a battle led by Aldric's combat monk group nearly ended in total annihilation. Aldric was the sole survivor.\nThis defeat provided the Silent Order with an excuse: they stripped Aldric of his monk attire, sealed his residence, and even began to tarnish the reputation his father had built over many years. Of course, they also uprooted the sacred tree.\nAldric's eruption surprised even himself. The dormant Vyraska bloodline within him awakened, and it dawned on the Silent Order that the Vyraska clan had been targeted in the past due to the berserk power of their bloodline.\nThe two steel whips extended and entwined from Aldric's hands, merging with his body, and transforming into two vicious and resilient vines.\n\"The Strangler.\" This was the name left by the Silent Order's investigation team when facing a dungeon filled with corpses and an empty cell."
